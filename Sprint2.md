The backend has taken up user stories pertaining to communities, profile and posts
So now the API to create, edit, get, delete posts, communities and profile has been created. Go tests cases are created for the posts, signup and login for the sprint.
CRUD tasks for posts, communities and profile has been created with exception of DELETE Profile.

#### Posts
##### API : CreatePost, EditPost, GetPost, DeletePost, GetAllPosts

#### Communities
##### API : CreateCommunity, GetCommunity, EditCommunity, DeleteCommunity, CheckCommunityExists

##### Profile
###### API : CreateProfile, Edit Profile
###### Note: DeleteProfile is moved to Sprint 3 as it depends on token authorization apart from username match.

##### GoTests
###### Tests : User module (Signup, Login), Posts (Create, Delete, Edit, Get)
